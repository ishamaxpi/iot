# Era of Internet Of Things(IOT)
IOT refers for Internet Of Things. It is the concept of basically connecting any device(including everything from cellphones, coffee makers, washing machines, headphones, lamps, wearable devices and many more) with Internet.Say for example you are on your way to a meeting; your car could have access to your calendar and already know the best route to take. If the traffic is heavy your car might send a text to the other party notifying them that you will be late. What if your alarm clock wakes up you at 6 a.m. and then notifies your coffee maker to start brewing coffee for you? What if your office equipment knew when it was running low on supplies and automatically re-ordered more?  What if the wearable device you used in the workplace could tell you when and where you were most active and productive and shared that information with other devices that you used while working?
